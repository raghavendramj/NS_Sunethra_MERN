Express.js is a small framework that works on top of Node.js web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. 
It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with middleware and routing. 
It adds helpful utilities to Node.js HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.

Why Express ?
	Develops Node.js web applications quickly and easily.
	It’s simple to set up and personalize.
	Allows you to define application routes using HTTP methods and URLs.
	Includes a number of middleware modules that can be used to execute additional requests and responses activities.
	Simple to interface with a variety of template engines, including Jade, Vash, and EJS.
	Allows you to specify a middleware for handling errors.
